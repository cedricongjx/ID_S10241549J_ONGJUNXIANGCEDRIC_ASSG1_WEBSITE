<div class="keshi-info">
    <h2>Casey Thai Luong (born November 4, 1994), known professionally as KESHI, is a Vietnamese American singer, songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist. He is best known for his songs "Like I Need U", "Limbo", and "Drunk".</h2>

    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    <p>Luong was born in Houston, Texas, to parents of Vietnamese origin and grew up in Sugar Land. Despite living in an ethnically diverse community with a large Asian American population, he often felt out of place and disconnected from his heritage while growing up, as others around him were mostly of other ethnic groups. He also added that he "wasn't the same as my American friends either, who would have the traditional American experience with the barbecues and all."</p>
    
    <p>When he was 13, he began learning the guitar after picking it up from his grandfather. He began teaching himself the instrument while using his grandfather's Vietnamese music book. Another one of his motivations for learning guitar came from watching Drake Bell on the Nickelodeon series Drake & Josh. He cites John Mayer and Ed Sheeran as his biggest influences as a child.</p>

    <p>He graduated from Stephen F. Austin High School and earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from the University of Texas at Austin. He then worked as an oncology nurse at the Texas Medical Center for two years.</p>

    <p>The stage name "Keshi" comes from the childhood name that his fianc√©e's parents gave him. They have been childhood friends since fifth grade. Whenever he visited, her parents would call him "Keshi", which they still do to this day.</p>

    <h3>Career</h3>
    <p>Luong adopted the moniker "Keshi" and began to share music via his SoundCloud page around 2017. He credited tutorial videos on YouTube for teaching him in writing, producing, and engineering music. In 2019, he quit his job as a nurse and moved to New York City to sign with Island Records.</p>

    <p>Keshi cites John Mayer, Frank Ocean, the 1975, Drake, and Bryson Tiller as his musical influences.</p>
